  [#116](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/116)
* Added an optional `ProductCategory` of a `Service`. As defined in NeTEx and SIRI, a product category is a classification for VEHICLE JOURNEYs 
  to express some common properties of journeys for marketing and fare products.

  [#92](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/92)
* Added `AllowedSystemId` to `InitialInputStructure`: In a distributed environment, a place information request can refer to several regional
  systems. This parameter allows the client to restrict the request to a specific system.
  [#63](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/63)
* Added `ReferredSystemId` in `TopographicPlaceStructure`: In a distributed environment, the process of place identification can be a two-step
  process. In the first step, a topographic place (e.g. city, municipality) is identified from the user input, in the second step, the system
  related to the topographic place is queried for places. In order to do so, the topographic places from the first step need to carry the
  information which system they relate to.
  [#62](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/62)
* Added `ProtoProduct` in `FareProductStructure` to allow carrying product related information to be processed further and used for tariffing
  in a distributed environment, where OJP services can deliver only parts of a fare product.

* Added scripts to generate documentation tables HTML from XSD.
 [#131](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/131) [#154](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/154)


### Changed

* **[breaking]** Made `MultiPointType` a required parameter in `OJPMultiPointTripRequest`. [#353](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/353)
* **[breaking]** Changed main namespace from `SIRI` to `OJP`. [#347](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/347)
* Updated all examples to new request and response structures, added to GitHub. [#334](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/334)
* **[breaking]** Replaced `TravelClass` with `siri:FareClass` which uses the NeTEx enumeration values. [#354](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/354), [#359](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/359)
* Reorganised `BaseTripPolicyGroup` so as to align the parameters in `MultiPointTripPolicyGroup` with `TripPolicyGroup` [#333](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/333)
* **[breaking]** Updated to SIRI 2.1 using a copy and adapted imports. [#330](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/330)
* Done and then largely undone. First change: Renamed `Location` to `Place`: According to TRANSMODEL a "location" is only a geographical position, while a "place" consists of a location and other attributes. This change distinguishes the two terms properly, which were used inconsistently in OJP. In most cases the term "location" was 
  replaced by the term "place". This applies to type and element names but also to annotations. [#82](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/82) [#99](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/99). Second change: Renamed `OJP_Places.xsd` to `OJP_Location.xsd`, `OJP_PlaceSupport.xsd` to `OJP_LocationSupport.xsd`, `OJPPlaceInformationRequest` to `OJPLocationInformationRequest`, as well as the related Delivery, structures and groups; renamed `Place` to `Location` in the StopEvent service and `TripPlace` to `TripLocation`. [#231](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/231)
* Corrected several typos. [#320](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/320),  [#343](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/343)
* **[breaking]** Renamed elements in `ExchangePointsResponseGroup`: `ExchangePointResponseContext` to `ExchangePointsResponseContext`, `Place` to `ExchangePointsResult`. [#295](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/295)
* Removed obsolete code in *OJPRequestSupport.xsd*. [#294](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/294)
* `WaitDuration`: changed to standard order of attributes. [#286](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/286)
* **[breaking]** Renamed `ReferredSystemId` and `AllowedSystemId` to `ReferredSystem` and `AllowedSystem`, respectively. [#244](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/244)
* **[breaking]** Renamed \*`TripLeg`\* to \*`Leg`\*. [#230](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/230) 
* **[breaking]** Replaced `EntitlementProductRef`s with a `EntitlementProductListStructure`, allowing for data like `EntitlementProductName` or `ValidityPeriod` for each `EntitlementProduct` in the list. [#229](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/229)
* **[breaking]** Redefined `VatRate` as a percentage instead of an enumeration. [#228](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/228)
* **[breaking]** Replaced `coord` with `location` in `PlaceTypeEnumeration`. [#218](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/218)
* **[breaking]** Renamed `PointOfInterestCode` and `AddressCode` to `PublicCode`, `PointOfInterestName` and `AddressName` to `Name`. [#217](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/217)
* **[breaking]** Renamed `ResultId`s in `ResultStructure`s to `Id`, as well as `LegId` in `LegStructure` and `TripId` in `TripStructure`. [#215](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/215)
* Corrected `schemaLocation` for *siri_reference-v2.0.xsd*. [#211](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/211)
* **[breaking]** Renamed `ErrorMessage` to `Problem`, `Code` to `Type`, `Text` to `Title` and added `Details` and `LogData`; added dedicated \*`ProblemStructure`s for each request, enumerating the possible types, some of which were previously only defined in the documentation, some not defined at all; added the `Problem` element to the \*`ResultStructure`s. Renamed some problem types, e.g., `FARES_`\* to `FARE_`\*, `MULTIPOINTTRIP_TOOMANYPOINTS` to `TRIP_MULTIPOINT_TOOMANYPOINTS`. [#203](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/203)
* Bug fix: renamed `MinimumBookingPeriod.` to `MinimumBookingPeriod`. [#163](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/163)

* **[breaking]** Renamed `PrivateCode` to `DomainCode`.
  [#94](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/94)
* **[breaking]** Renamed `PublishedLineName` to `PublishedServiceName`.
  [#89](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/89)
* **[breaking]** Replaced `AcceptDeferredDelivery` in `TripPolicyFilterGroup` by `TripSummaryOnly` in `TripContentFilterGroup` as the parameter to control 
  whether to deliver complete trips or only trip summaries. The concept of a deferred delivery has been removed. Additionally, replaced 
  `MultiPointTripContentFilterGroup` in `MultiPointTripParamStructure` by `TripContentFilterGroup` as legs are mandatory within trip results.

  changed `InfoUrl` in `GeneralAttributeStructure` to `Url`.
  [#123](https://github.com/VDVde/OJP/pull/123)
* Set the default value `anyPoint` for `MultiPointType` in `MultiPointTripPolicyGroup` so the default response does not have to contain a trip
  result for each of the given origins and destinations but only for one of them.
